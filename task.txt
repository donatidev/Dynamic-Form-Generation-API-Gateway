We are building an API-gateway. Because different systems we connect to 
require different initial parameters to make requests, our API-gateway 
needs to ask the user for some extra inputs in order to make a call to the
system.

For example, in the database we have users' First name and Last name.
In order to connect to some system, we need to provide:
- First name
- Last name
- Birthdate
- Birthplace
- Sex
- Current address
As you can see, there are certain missing fields that we need to ask
from the user (Birthdate, Birthplace, Sex, Current address).
Therefore, we need to build dynamic form based on the backend response,
that asks the user to provide those missing fields.

We should use Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring MVC.

Your task is to create sample Spring Boot application that has 2 endpoints:
1. Imagine what backend endpoint to get which fields are missing in 
order to render the form may look like. Based on that:
Create REST endpoint that:
  - Reads available fields from database
  - Reads required fields from database
  - Computes which fields are necessary to be received from user
  - Produce the JSON-response from the above. Frontend should be 
  able to generate dynamic form out of this response.
  
2. Imagine what backend endpoint to post this dynamic form may look like.
Create REST endpoint that:
   - Persists user response
   - Imitates the call to some imaginary 3rd party service with the
   all the necessary parameters (First name, Last name, Birthdate,
   Birthplace, Sex, Current address) using Spring boot + Feign.
   The imaginary service API URL must come from database

We would like to see:
Sample application with 2 endpoints as described.

Do not spend more than 3 hours on the task. Application might be not fully functional, we are interested in your approach.
